Wrote a query to determine if customers met 1 of 2 criteria needed to pitch a product. If customer met criteria they were labeled as 1 and 0 if not to simplify it.


SELECT customerid,
count(productid) as num_products,
sum(numberofusers) as total_users,
case
when count(PRODUCTID) <= 1 or sum(NUMBEROFUSERS) > 5000 then 1
else 0
end as upsell_opportunity
FROM subscriptions subs
group by customerid;
