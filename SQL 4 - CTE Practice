Wrote a query to show how many times an email link was clicked and how many users clicked once, twice etc..

with clicks AS (

SELECT 
    userid,
    count(eventid) AS link_clicks
FROM 
    frontendeventlog
WHERE 
    eventid = 5
group by 
    userid)

SELECT
    count(userid) AS num_users,
    link_clicks AS num_link_clicks
FROM 
    clicks
group by 
    link_clicks;
