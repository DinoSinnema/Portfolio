Wrote a CTE to combine all cancelation reason then wrote an aggregate function to sum up this number. 
After this I divided it by the total number of cancelled subscriptions to determine how many were due to the cost of the subscription. 
Had to use UNION (instead of UNION ALL since options could be double counted) and combine multiple tables since there were 3 options for cancelation reasons.
Converted the numerator to a decimal with float and found the percentage that cancelled due to cost.

-- SQL request(s)​​​​​​‌​‌​‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​ below
with all_cancelation_reasons as(

select 
        subscriptionid,

select

        case when cancelationreason = 'Expensive' 
        then subscriptionid end) as float)
