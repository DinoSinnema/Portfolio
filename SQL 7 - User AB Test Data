Pulled data from two users who saw two different web pages to see what icons they clicked. 
Helped determine how many times the user clicked buttons for help our assistance.

SELECT 
    userid,
    sum(case when el.eventid = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as viewedhelpcenterpage,
    sum(case when el.eventid = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as clickedfaqs,
    sum(case when el.eventid = 3 then 1 else 0 end) as clickedcontactsupport,
    sum(case when el.eventid = 4 then 1 else 0 end) as submittedticket
FROM Frontendeventlog el
