An email to all sales department managers was needed. Self-joined the employees table to find the name and email of the managers of each employee. 
Goal was to send an email to every employee’s manager about changes, but some employee ID had no managers. 
Used the COALESCE function to pick the managers employee ID email whenever the email was listed as null. Very confusing.
